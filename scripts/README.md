## Available Scripts

### test-trip-planning.sh

Automated test script for the Trip Planning API.

**Usage:**
```bash
./test-trip-planning.sh
```

**What it does:**
- Checks if port 8080 is in use and cleans it up
- Starts the server with API key from `local.properties`
- Waits for server to be ready (health check)
- Runs multiple test scenarios:
  - Basic trip planning (Central to Circular Quay)
  - Trip with specific time (Parramatta to Central @ 9 AM)
  - Trip excluding trains (buses/ferries only)
  - Trip with arrival time
- Shows formatted results using jq
- Stops the server when you press Enter

**Requirements:**
- `jq` installed: `brew install jq`
- Valid API key in `local.properties`

**Logs:**
Server logs are written to `/tmp/krail-server.log`

**Example output:**
```
